## Guidelines for contributing

CrowdVoc intends to be a community effort, as such it welcomes several types of contributions. 

#### Issues
Discussion is handled using Github issues opening and or participating. We have created the following labels:


**Use Case**: For the proposal and discussion of use cases
A good use case description should be structured as follows:

- Use case name
- Stakeholders
- Description
- Existing approaches (Using other vocabularies)
- Links to other issues (if any)

Eventually, links to requirements

**Requirement**: For proposal and discussion of requirements 

A requirement is a concise description of a feature of the vocabulary. Linked to the use cases that require it


**Alignment**: For the proposal and discussion of alignments with other vocabularies and ontologies, including property re-use


**Classes / Properties** For the proposal and discussion of classes and/or properties definitions within the Ontology. Commonly, these * issues should be linked to a requirement or use case

#### Pull Requests

You may contribute via pull requests with updates or corrections. Just make sure that they close a currently open issue


#### Code of Conduct

We thrive to maintain a positive work environment, as such, we encourage all participants to abide to the W3C code of conduct https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/
